# Vigenere cipher

Encryption AND decryption of the Vigenere cipher with 26 English letters and 1 space character "_" as tableau diagram.

# Permutation and Inverse Permutation

 Takes in a permutation of n elements( 0 to n - 1 ), and outputs its inverse permutation.
 
 # DES encryption
 
Output of each of the 16 rounds in the DES encryption, as shown in Figure 3.7 , but ignorE the Intial Permutation block, the 32-bit swap block and the Inverse Initial Permutation block

 # Performance Measurements
 
Comparing the throughput performance of DES, 3DES and AES by encrypting and decrypting a message of certain size (around 1MB) in

1. ECB mode
2. CBC mode

 #  Extended Euclid Algorithm
  
output a, b and c = gcd(u,v) for the following inputs: u = 612898 and v = 765051
  
  #  RSA Throughput
  
Throughput performance of RSA, both encryption (using e) and decryption (using d), for following parameters:
  
1. n: 768 bits, e = 65537
2. n: 1024 bits, e = 5

# Hash Throughputs

Throughput performance of MD5, RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256 using about 1 MB data.

# Diffusion Property of Hash

Getting diffusion property of MD5, RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256 using about 1KB data, by changing 1 byte of data in the following locations, record the the number and locations of the bits that change in the resulting hash outputs:

1. first byte
2. last byte
3. random byte
